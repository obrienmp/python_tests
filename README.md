Tournament Project for Udacity course Intro to Relational Databases
version 1.0 09/08/2017

The following flies are for the Tournament Project for the Udacity course Intro to Relational Databases.  This is my proposed solution for completing the project for a Swiss-style game tournament.  The program allows users to register players, delete players and matches, report match outcomes, view standings, and see a possible match up of opponents for the next round of matches.  This is in no way the only way to solve the problem, it only represents my approach to solving it.
